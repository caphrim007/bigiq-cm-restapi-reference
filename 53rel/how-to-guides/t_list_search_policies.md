## Listing Web Application Security policies and searching for a specific policy by name.

### Overview

Describes how you use the REST API to list all policies and to retrieve a link to an existing policy by a policy name.

### Prerequisites

None.

### Description

Describes how you use the REST API to list all policies and to retrieve a link to an existing policy by a policy name.

Perform the REST API actions in the following order:

1. Perform a GET operation to return all policies.
2. Perform a GET operation to return a specific policy using a filter.

The following extended example shows each of these REST API actions.

#### 1. Perform a GET operation to return all policies.
Perform a GET operation on the policies collection, limiting the result to show specific fields that are defining those resources, together with a link to retrieve all the policy properties (selfLink). In this example two policies are retrieved named name Policy_1 and Policy_2. Both exist in the Common partition, as can be seen in the fullPath field value in the example).
```
GET: https://<mgmtip>/mgmt/cm/asm/working-config/policies?$select=name,fullPath,selfLink
```
The following is the JSON response from the GET operation:
```
{
    "items": [
        {
            "fullPath": "/Common/Policy_1",
            "name": "Policy_1",
            "selfLink": "https://localhost/mgmt/cm/asm/working-config/policies/1005831c-7e40-30ed-bd0d-f8068526d7ef"
        },
        {
            "fullPath": "/Common/Policy_2",
            "name": "Policy_2",
            "selfLink": "https://localhost/mgmt/cm/asm/working-config/policies/240b8504-53df-322f-9faa-008b5f0bc988"
        }
    ],
    "generation": 9,
    "kind": "cm:asm:working-config:policies:policycollectionstate",
    "lastUpdateMicros": 1478688837870194,
    "selfLink": "https://localhost/mgmt/cm/asm/working-config/policies"
}
```
#### 2. Perform a GET operation to return a specific policy using a filter.
Perform a GET operation on the policies collection, filtering the results by a name and limiting the result to show specific fields that are defining the resource, together with a link to retrieve all the policy properties (selfLink). In this example the name being searched for is 'Policy_1'.
```
GET: https://<mgmtip>/mgmt/cm/asm/working-config/policies?$filter=name eq 'Policy_1'&$select=name,fullPath,selfLink
```
The following is the JSON response from the GET operation:
```
{
    "selfLink": "https://localhost/mgmt/cm/asm/working-config/policies",
    "totalItems": 1,
    "items": [
        {
            "fullPath": "/Common/Policy_1",
            "name": "Policy_1",
            "selfLink": "https://localhost/mgmt/cm/asm/working-config/policies/1005831c-7e40-30ed-bd0d-f8068526d7ef"
        }
    ],
    "generation": 9,
    "kind": "cm:asm:working-config:policies:policycollectionstate",
    "lastUpdateMicros": 1478688837870194
}
```
